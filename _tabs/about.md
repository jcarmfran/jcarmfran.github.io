My most recent position was with Microsoft as an Azure Networking Support Engineer. I was survived a few rounds of layoffs within our team and managed to fulfill my 18-month contract at the end of January. Seeing as my wife was due in mid February, things couldn't have lined up any better.

While I may have stepped away from work to care for my wife and (very adorable) baby, I've continued to pursue an interest in AI that was first sparked about a year ago. It started off as a small Microsoft provided introductory course on AI. More than a year removed since, I've now find myself developing web apps that utilize deep learning techniques to detect signs of pneumonia given a single x-ray image of a patient's lungs, a chatbot that answers questions from user provided PDFs, and even a text analyzer that determines if tweets (or whatever they're called now) are disaster related.

This may not have been something that I thought I would be doing a year ago, but I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Forever curious, I can't help but feel the need to constantly grow and expand my knowledge base.

Whether it's diving into a new technology stack or tackling complex problems, Iâ€™m committed to expanding my expertise. In other words, I'm comfortable feeling uncomfortable. 

I genuinely look forward to the coming challenges this new chapter in my career entails.

So you still want to know more...

Well, I guess can rattle off some one liners:

    - I dabble in philosophy from time to time.
    - Thanks to people like Peter Zeihan, I've turned into a bit of a geopolitics nerd.
    - I like meditating. I actually find it kind of fun. That's right, fun.
